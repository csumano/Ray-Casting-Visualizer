      <b>Purpose:</b>
      <br> This project demonstrates an important
      computer graphics concept, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">Ray Casting</a>. Ray casting solves various 
      3D problems with the use of intersection tests. In this project you are 
      the eye and the canvas is a 3D space and the ray cast is the mouse.
      Clicking will determine a (x,y,z) cooridinate in 3D space to create a 
      visible point. A segment is drawn from the first ray cast to the next in 
      (x,y) space. Pressing shift will stop the ray cast. We can take these (x,y,z) 
      cooridinates to calculate a three dimensional space to create a solid geometric object. The 
      user can also turn on and off the ray case segments to visualize how it works.    
      <br> <b>Directions:</b>
      <br> <b>CLICK MOUSE </b> - to create a point(s)
      <br> <b>SHIFT</b> - button to stop drawing segments
      <br> Press the 'Make3D' button to turn the segments into 3D
      <br>  - Afterwards use the mouse to click on the canvas and move around the world space
      <br> Press the 'AddSegments' to draw more lines (world movement is fixed)
      <br> Press the 'RayCast' to see visible ray cast lines (indicated with an arrow)
      <br> Press the 'RemoveRayCast' to remove and stop ray cast lines
      <br> Press the 'reset' button to reset the canvas
